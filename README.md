- **I2C Sensor Circuit**:
  - ![I2C Sensor Breadboard]

## Description
- The **GPIO conflict issue** was fixed by moving the push button from **GPIO3** (conflicting with SenseHAT) to **GPIO4**.
- The **I2C sensor circuit** shows a BMP280 connected to RPi's **SDA (GPIO2) and SCL (GPIO3)**.

## Instructions
- Open these images in Fritzing to view the exact wiring.
